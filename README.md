Project Overview

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

Project Requirements
Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:


Create a class hierarchy – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.



Declare instance variables – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.



Write constructors – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.



Implement accessor and mutator methods – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.



Implement a toString() method – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.


Project Rubric:
See the 7 criteria you must demostrate attached to this assignment. Each criteria lists out a mastery level.

Pushing Project To GitHub:
You must push your project to your GitHub account that you shared earlier in the semester. This should be the last thing you do after you finish your project on Code.org's JavaLab. There are 3 videos in the project folder that will help you do this
